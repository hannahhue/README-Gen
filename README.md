# Professional README Generator ![badge](https://badgen.net/github/license/micromatch/micromatch)

## Description

This program allows the user to easily fill out simple questions instead of trying to format and create a readme from memory. tHis was completed using Node.js. My motivation to complete this project was to further my ability to import and use libraries, and give future me a more efficient way to produce professional README.md files. It solves my issue of constantly referring back to a readme template and will get me into the habit of focusing more on content rather than format. I learned about importing, terminal prompts and implementing const’s instead of vars.
